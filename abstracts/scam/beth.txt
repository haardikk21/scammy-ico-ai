Beth is the first ever closed-end fund focused on applying the latest advances in deep learning research combined with financial expertise. Beth will provide an opportunity for anyone interested in being part of a new generation fund that will reduce the risks and complications in favor of using Deep Learning techniques. We are developing complex trading models and strategies with the possibility of learning, developing and improving over time. Beth is a level above the conventional solutions and will allow obtaining great returns of the investment from the first days thanks to the technology that is behind her.

Beth is the name of our solution, which will be based on DL techniques (Deep Learning), which is responsible for managing the Beth Fund. We will all be part of Beth, as she will constantly learn from the information received. We have been working from May 2016 till Sept 2016 in designing the basic concept of the project.

Beth Fund opens up this new sector for all who wish to be part of a new decentralized economy in constant movement and growth. We are aware that Beth will become one of the most far-reaching businesses this year and the next, and it will be our job to meet those expectations. Any user can participate freely and without limitation to be part of Beth being part of our Initial Coin Offering that will take place in a few days.

Beth will choose the assets (a mixture of bitcoin, ethereum, altcoins, tokens and other cryptoassets) based on our complex trading models and strategies that we made thanks to the use of Deep Learning techniques combined with our financial expertise.
