While  several  consensus  algorithms  exist  for  the  Byzantine  Generals  Problem,  specifically  as  itpertains to distributed payment systems, many suffer from high latency induced by the requirementthat all nodes within the network communicate synchronously.   In this work,  we present a novelconsensus algorithm that circumvents this requirement by utilizing collectively-trusted subnetworkswithin the larger network. We show that the “trust” required of these subnetworks is in fact minimaland can be further reduced with principled choice of the member nodes.  In addition, we show thatminimal connectivity is required to maintain agreement throughout the whole network. The result is alow-latency consensus algorithm which still maintains robustness in the face of Byzantine failures. Wepresent this algorithm in its embodiment in the Ripple Protocol.
