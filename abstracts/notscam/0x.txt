We describe a protocol that facilitates low friction peer-to-peer exchange of ERC20 tokens on theEthereum blockchain.  The protocol is intended to serve as an open standard and common buildingblock, driving interoperability among decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchangefunctionality.  Trades are executed by a system of Ethereum smart contracts that are publicly acces-sible, free to use and that any dApp can hook into.  DApps built on top of the protocol can accesspublic liquidity pools or create their own liquidity pool and charge transaction fees on the resultingvolume.  The protocol is unopinionated:  it does not impose costs on its users or arbitrarily extractvalue from one group of users to benefit another.  Decentralized governance is used to continuouslyand securely integrate updates into the base protocol without disrupting dApps or end users.1
