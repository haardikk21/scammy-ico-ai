This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achievesrobustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determinesystem-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and tran-sit decisions now unify the Internet.We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agree-ment protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantineagreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open member-ship that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stakeschemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and poten-tially opening up financial systems to new participants
