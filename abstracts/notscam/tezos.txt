We present Tezos, a generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. Tezoscan instantiate any blockchain based ledger. The operations of a regularblockchain are implemented as a purely functional module abstracted intoa shell responsible for network operations. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptonote,etc. can all be represented within Tezos by implementing the proper in-terface to the network layer.Most importantly, Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols canevolve by amending their own code. To achieve this, Tezos begins witha seed protocol defining a procedure for stakeholders to approve amend-ments to the protocol,includingamendments to the voting procedureitself. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suber’s Nomic[3], a game builtaround a fully introspective set of rules.In addition, Tezos’s seed protocol is based on a pure proof-of-stakesystem and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Tezos is imple-mented in OCaml, a powerful functional programming language offeringspeed, an unambiguous syntax and semantic, and an ecosystem makingTezos a good candidate for formal proofs of correctness.Familiarity with the Bitcoin protocol and basic cryptographic primi-tives are assumed in the rest of this paper.1
