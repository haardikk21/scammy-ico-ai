Mainstream adoption of blockchain systems has been limited due to unsolved questionsof scalability, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we will outline a proposed designfor the Aion Network; a 3rd generation multi-tier blockchain system designed to addressthese challenges. Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be createdto solve unique business challenges, within unique industries. As such, the Aion Networkis designed to support custom blockchain architectures, while providing a trustless mech-anism for cross-chain interoperability. At the root of this system is the worldâ€™s first dedi-cated public enterprise blockchain, Aion-1; a state of the art blockchain that introduces anew paradigm of security, and fair, representative crypto-economic incentives.
